# Simple proof-of-work blockchain in Programming Language

This is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Python using Flask. The code defines a `Block` class to represent a block in the chain, and a `Blockchain` class to represent the entire chain. The `Blockchain` class contains several methods to manage the chain, including methods to add new blocks and to validate the proof-of-work for each block.
